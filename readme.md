# Creational Patterns

## Abstract Factory
> Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes. [[1]](#1)

## Builder
> Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. [[2]](#2)

## Factory Method
> Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. [[3]](#3) 

## Prototype
> Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes. [[4]](#4)

### Centralized Prototype
> Centralized prototype registry (or factory), which would contain a set of pre-defined prototype objects. [[4]](#4)

## Singleton

> Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code. [[5]](#5)
